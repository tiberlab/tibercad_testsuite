HOW TO CREATE TESTSUITE EXAMPLES
--------------------------------

1. Create a new directory called testXXX, where XXX is a number

2. Copy the files from template into testXXX and adapt them to your needs

3. Add the input and mesh file (and perhaps the source for the mesh
   for future reference) and the material files to the directory

4. Put the reference output files into a subdirectory "reference"

5. As output directory, specify "output"

6. Before committing, check if it works...


HOW TO RUN TESTSUITE EXAMPLES
-----------------------------

./run_tests -t <directory_name>

See ./run_tests -h for help

To run all tests you can also say

make run_tests

in the toplevel directory.
